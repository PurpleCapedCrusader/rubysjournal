                <!--Very short paragraph about Ruby.-->
                <p>This is the story of Ruby Moery, a magnificent, strong, amazing woman who
                    persevered even in the face of terrible tragedy, pain, and loss. She
                    endured many hardships but always kept a smile on her face throughout
                    her 82 years. Those of us left behind are lucky to have a snapshot of
                    her life, as told through the 40 years of daily diary entries which she
                    diligently kept. Although Ruby's nightly entries are brief,
                    together, like small mosaic tiles, they allow us to see the beauty of
                    who she was and the love she had for others.</p>
